## Introduction

This is not just another space robot shooter game. Your planet is under threat as the asteroids are approaching with uncertain speed. Your mission is to destroy them all before your battery is drained out completely and making you offline permanently. However, you can look for golden stars to recharge battery.

Survive till you go full offline!
